${POKEMON_ENDPOINT}type/${type}?limit=100000 - probably parameterise that limit (maybe with an environment variable)
deleting stuff from a source object is bad - you’re destroying data with no audit trail/way to revers. Create a new object and copy out the properties you want

{" "} <-- for react you just do {" "}

Try to pass things into functions rather than rely on scope and order

If you define functions inside a component then it will recreate those functions every time - useCallback will help with that (the new compiler will actually remove this need)

DRY - Don’t repeat yourself. If you see repeated code, like pokemonData.types[0] then de-structure that to a variable and then use or de-structure that variable further, so you’re not saying pokemonData repeatedly.

In assembleTypeData , for example, I think you could just use a loop there, no? You’re just fetching for each, so for (const type of pokemonData.types)

There’s lots of defensive checks and I think that’s generally a sign of muddled logic when you’re having to check 4 random conditions, whose meaning isn’t clear, before you do something. I find writing pseudo-code and then adding the real code helps here. Also, try labelling your data, so const isNonUserChoice = pokemonData.name !== userChoice

define state types more strictly

copy out api responses to give only required data
